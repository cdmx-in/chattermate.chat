Profile pictures taken from a sign-in provider.

A team member without a profile picture gets their SSO account's photo. It is
fetched after the sign-in has answered (a background task that holds no
database connection while it downloads), so a slow photo host never holds up
the sign-in, and a picture the person uploaded is never replaced, even one
uploaded while the photo was on its way.
